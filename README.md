# SiPhox Health Technical Assignment

This repository contains my solutions to the technical assignment for the SiPhox Health position. Each task is implemented in a separate JSFiddle, and the details are documented below.

## Task 1 - Scroll to Section
[JSFiddle Link](https://jsfiddle.net/0xnwje2d/1/)

Implemented a scroll-to-section feature without using traditional anchors. Each button in the menu is associated with a specific section, and clicking on a button smoothly scrolls the page to the corresponding section using the `scrollIntoView` method. This approach provides a clean and dynamic user experience without relying on anchor tags.

## Task 2 - Gradient Animation on Hover

Enhanced the component to include a div element with the class "gradient-animation" that serves as the background for the gradient animation. The CSS includes a hover effect on the container, triggering the gradient animation and applying it to the div. The animation smoothly transitions the gradient from right to left. Feel free to adjust the animation properties to achieve the desired effect.

## Task 3 - Custom Multiselect Component
[JSFiddle Link](https://jsfiddle.net/cxrjh4fn/)

Implemented a custom multiselect component from scratch. When closed, it displays selected items separated by commas. On clicking, it opens a list where you can check/uncheck items. The `toggleSelect` function manages the selection state, and the `toggleDropdown` function controls the open/close state of the dropdown. The implementation focuses on functionality, and styling is not included as per the task requirements.

## Task 4 - Generate Order Summary

Implemented the `generateOrderSummary` function that efficiently generates order summaries for each order. The function utilizes map objects to perform constant-time lookups for users and products based on their IDs, resulting in an optimized solution.
